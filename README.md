# The Gaming Room is a video game software company, with the desire to expand on one of their products.  They required a more fleshed out program that could handle a larger number of users at a time, 
# creating a seamless environment.
# I believe that being able to translate what the company wanted into a readable code was the most important thing to do in this assignment, making sure the company got what they paid for.
# The design document was a really helpful tool, as it kept everything organized for the project in one single space.  This way we did not have to be spread out between different files if we did not want to.
# The first few pages (executive summary, domain model, etc) would be helpful to revise a little bit, now that we have the hindsight of how we managed this product down the road.
# We interpreted the client's needs by vitally understanding what the company was about; their business model, their target audience, etc.  Knowing this, we can program to a set demographic of PC users.
# To approach the software design, we understood what the client was asking for, and through trial and error, created what was necessary for the end result.
